# spykes

Spykes is a collection of tools to make the visualization and analysis of neural data easy and reproducible.

At present, this project comes with two packages:
- ```spykes``` helps you plot beautiful spike rasters and peri-stimulus time histograms
- ```neuropop``` helps you estimate tuning curves of neural populations and decode preferred stimuli from population vectors

Documentation, tutorials and examples are coming soon!
